My research focuses on integrating **Privacy Enhancing Technologies** into the **IoT Ecosystem**.
Depending on the scenario and problem we use privacy enhancing techniques to design schemes/protocols.
For my current research we mostly utilize the **UAV Domain** (see [publications page](/publications.md)).
As a byproduct of my research we can identify the trade-off between **privacy** and **energy consumption**.
In addition, we use [ProVerif](https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/) to symbolically verify the correctness of our designed protocols against the **Dolev-Yao attacker model**.

My work is currently supervised by [Dr. Savio Sciancalepore] (https://ssciancalepore.win.tue.nl/) at the [Security Group] (https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/computer-science/security) of the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/research) at TU/e.
